# Custom policy assignments

It is possible to tailor the Policy Definitions that are deployed and assigned by developing custom archetypes. This example demonstrates a situation where only Service Health is deployed:

- Deploy using a custom management group hierarchy defined by architecture definition file in the local library.
- Use a custom root archetype to ensure that the Service Health policy definitions and assignments are deployed.
